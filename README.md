🏦 Intelligent Loan Approval System using XGBoost
This project aims to automate the loan approval process by predicting the likelihood of a customer defaulting on a loan. By leveraging historical financial data, the system helps banks minimize risk and improve decision-making accuracy.
📊 Project Highlights
Accuracy: 93.02% achieved using XGBoost.
Top Features: Loan-to-Income Ratio, Previous Default History, and Interest Rate.
Dataset: 45,000+ customer records with financial and demographic attributes.
🛠️ Tech Stack
Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, Matplotlib, Seaborn
Algorithms: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost (Best)
🚀 Key Achievements
Data Cleaning: Handled outliers (e.g., ages > 100) and encoded categorical variables like Education and Home Ownership.
Feature Engineering: Identified critical factors affecting loan status using Feature Importance analysis.
Visualization: Created a Decision Tree map to visualize the logic behind loan approvals.
